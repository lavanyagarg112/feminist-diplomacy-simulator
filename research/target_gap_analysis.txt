Target-gap analysis (binding constraints)

Resources (binding): The gap to a 75% gender-tag target and ~20% principal objective is the largest single drag on credibility. Without higher principal intensity and verifiable CSO channeling, policy claims risk appearing allocation-light.

Institutional depth (conditional binding): Strategy and NAP presence are necessary but not sufficient; the constraint is cross-ministry embedding (focal points, budgeting practices). If embedding lags, credibility is vulnerable to leadership turnover or agenda fatigue.

Norm-setting (amplifier, not primary constraint): Additional EU/G7 chair roles or coalition leadership can improve perception, but they are not binding if resource and depth gaps persist.

Implication: Prioritize raising principal objective share and verified CSO funding while continuing institutional embedding; marginal gains in norm leadership alone will not close the credibility gap.
