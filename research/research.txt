France’s “Feminist Diplomacy” After Sweden: Leadership Credibility and Contradictions
Context: Sweden’s Pioneer Role and Withdrawal
Sweden launched the world’s first Feminist Foreign Policy (FFP) in 2014 under Margot Wallström, embedding gender equality into all foreign policy areas[1][2]. The Swedish FFP was built on the “3 Rs” (rights, representation, resources) and a “reality check,” yielding tangible achievements – from pushing women, peace & security at the UN Security Council to strengthening laws against gender-based violence[3]. This bold approach earned Sweden a global reputation as a feminist diplomacy pioneer[2]. However, in October 2022 Sweden’s new government abruptly abandoned the feminist label, arguing it “obscures” Sweden’s interests[4]. Sweden formally ended its FFP in 2022, dropping the 1% of GNI aid commitment and the FFP branding (while claiming to still value gender equality)[5][6]. Sweden’s withdrawal was a blow to global feminist diplomacy efforts[7], leaving observers asking who would “carry the torch.” France – which had adopted its own feminist diplomacy in 2019 – has since positioned itself to assume leadership in this arena[8][9]. The question is: How credible is France’s claim to lead feminist diplomacy, and where do gaps exist between France’s lofty commitments and its real-world actions?
France’s Approach vs Sweden’s: Ambition and Branding
France’s feminist foreign policy (often termed “feminist diplomacy”) formally began in 2019 and was preceded by an International Strategy for Gender Equality (2018–2022)[10]. France was the fourth country to adopt an FFP (after Sweden, Canada, and Luxembourg)[11]. Like Sweden, France professes that women’s rights and gender equality are at the “center” of its foreign policy across all issues[12][13]. France’s new International Strategy for Feminist Diplomacy 2025–2030, launched in 2024, pledges to integrate a gender perspective “without exception” in peace and security, climate, economic, health, education, digital policy, etc.[13]. It is built on five pillars – defending rights and freedoms, women’s participation in decision-making, fighting inequalities, combatting gender-based violence, and mobilizing financing for equality[14]. In branding, France emphasizes sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) as a focus, co-chairing the 2021 Generation Equality Forum and championing abortion rights in multilateral fora[15][16]. Notably, France does not shy from the term “feminist diplomacy” and has even enshrined gender equality as a “great national cause” of President Macron’s term[17]. This contrasts with Sweden’s new government explicitly dropping the word “feminist” despite professing continued gender commitments[4].
What changed when Sweden stepped back? Sweden’s exit created both a leadership vacuum and a test for the durability of the feminist diplomacy norm. By 2022, some 15 countries had adopted or pledged feminist foreign policies[11][18], an international movement largely inspired by Sweden’s model. After Sweden’s retreat, France has sought to galvanize a coalition of feminist diplomat countries: it co-hosted global feminist forums and in 2024 announced it will host the 4th International Conference on Feminist Foreign Policy in 2025[16]. French Foreign Minister (then Catherine Colonna, now Stéphane Séjourné) asserted France’s “responsibility” to defend women’s rights worldwide in light of Sweden’s policy reversal[19]. In short, France stepped forward with new strategies and high-profile campaigns (on women’s voting rights, SRHR, etc.)[20] to claim the mantle of global FFP leadership. The credibility of this leadership, however, hinges on France’s ability to match Sweden’s depth of commitment and avoid contradictions between rhetoric and practice.
Resources: Rhetoric vs Funding Commitments
Funding and program commitments are a critical measure of credibility. Here, France’s official pledges are ambitious, but actual allocations reveal gaps. In 2021, France passed a law making gender equality a cross-cutting objective of its development aid, with a target that 75% of projects funded by French ODA should integrate gender equality by 2025 (20% with gender as the principal goal)[21]. This is a bold commitment, on paper approaching Canada’s and Sweden’s high levels of gender-focused aid. In practice, France is far from the 75% target. As of 2022-2023, only 46.4% of France’s bilateral aid was committed to programs with a gender equality objective[22] – roughly half of French aid is “gender-tagged,” which is in line with the DAC donor average but nowhere near the promised 75%. Only 6.3% of French aid had gender equality as a primary objective (principal focus)[23]. France’s trajectory is positive (up from just 13% of aid focused on gender in 2018[24]), but the credibility gap remains: the government’s own independent Gender Equality High Council noted that feminist diplomacy has been “too timidly supported… and relies on insufficient resources, both financial and human”[25]. In other words, budgets have not fully matched the feminist rhetoric.
By comparison, Sweden’s resources backing FFP were relatively robust. Sweden exceeded the 0.7% ODA/GNI target every year since 1975[26] and even had a 1% of GNI aid policy until 2022. Critically, Sweden mainstreamed gender across the bulk of its aid: 82% of Sweden’s development commitments in 2014–2020 were marked as gender-focused[27], with about 21% of aid targeting gender equality as the principal goal[27]. This far outstripped France’s current ~46% share[22]. (No country has yet met the UN target of 85% of aid addressing gender equality[28][22], but Sweden came close.) Sweden also poured funds into multilateral gender initiatives – historically one of the top donors to UN Women and UNFPA – and systematically required its embassies and aid agencies to apply a gender lens. This resource commitment gave Sweden’s FFP substance. France, despite increases, has yet to reach that level of funding integration. Half of French ODA going to gender equality is significant but still “far from the 75% target for 2025” that France set for itself[29].
Moreover, France’s overall aid volume and trajectory raise credibility questions. While Sweden long maintained ~1% GNI in aid (even after the FFP label was dropped, the new Swedish government fixed ODA at ~SEK 56 billion annually, roughly 0.8% GNI)[6], France has struggled to meet its aid targets. France’s parliament enshrined a goal to reach 0.7% GNI on ODA by 2025[30], and indeed France hit an interim 0.55% in 2022[30]. But since 2023 France has reversed course, cutting its aid budgets. A significant 11% drop in French ODA occurred in 2023 (₣1.6 billion less than 2022), and the 0.7% target was pushed back to 2030[31]. Further cuts in 2024 and 2025 mean France will “disinvest” an estimated €21 billion from planned development funds by 2030[32][33]. Such cuts undermine France’s credibility: lofty feminist goals become harder to fund when the aid envelope shrinks. The OECD has explicitly recommended that France mobilize more resources to fulfill its summit pledges and align budgets with its international commitments[34]. If France’s feminist diplomacy is to be credible, it must secure stable funding; instead, budget austerity is biting into its international solidarity efforts.
Dedicated feminist funding mechanisms are a bright spot for France – but even here, follow-through is key. France created a Support Fund for Feminist Organizations (FSOF) in 2019 to directly finance women’s rights groups abroad, a move widely applauded as innovative. Initially launched in 2020 with €120 million, the FSOF ultimately mobilized €134 million by 2022 for over 1,000 feminist organizations in ~70 countries[35]. In 2023, France doubled down, renewing the fund at €250 million for 2023–2027[36][37]. France touts this as making it the “world’s leading financier of feminist organizations”[38][39]. Indeed, France has been a “notable pioneer” in funding grassroots feminist movements, allocating about $97 million yearly to such groups (second only to Germany’s $118 million)[40]. This direct support is a credible commitment – it fills a vital gap, since globally only a sliver of gender-focused aid reaches women’s organizations[41][42]. However, France must ensure these funds are fully disbursed and accessible. The High Council’s review urged providing the strategy with adequate financial resources so that initiatives like the FSOF can expand[25][43]. In short, France has made promising funding pledges (e.g. continuing FSOF, co-launching a $40 billion global gender equality pledge at the Generation Equality Forum[38]), but delivery and transparency will determine credibility.
Budget transparency itself is a concern noted by observers. France’s feminist diplomacy lacks a clearly defined budget line, making it hard to track spending on gender equality[44][45]. The 2024 Gender in Geopolitics report flagged “the absence of a dedicated and transparent budget” for France’s FFP, which complicates monitoring and accountability[44][46]. More broadly, France’s development program has been criticized for opacity – Publish What You Fund ranked the French Development Agency only 35th of 50 in aid transparency in 2024 (a drop from prior years), and the Foreign Ministry itself is not even ranked due to limited data disclosure[47][48]. For a self-proclaimed champion of progressive values, this lack of transparency in funding is a credibility gap. By contrast, Sweden consistently scored well on aid effectiveness and transparency indices, reinforcing its reputation. If France wants to be seen as the new leader in feminist foreign policy, it will need to improve how it tracks and reports gender-equality spending – both to verify it is meeting targets and to build trust that it isn’t just “gender-washing” its aid. Right now, there is room for improvement, as the High Council gently noted in calling for “rigorous monitoring” and clearer benchmarks for France’s next strategy[49].
Institutional Depth: Policy Integration and Staying Power
A second test of France’s feminist diplomacy credibility is its institutional depth – how deeply the policy is embedded in government structures and whether it can withstand political shifts. Here, too, France shows both commitment and contradictions.
On one hand, France has taken steps to institutionalize gender equality in its foreign policy machinery. The Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs established a dedicated “Senior Official for gender equality” (Ambassadeur/directeur for equality) to coordinate internal and external gender efforts[50][51]. Gender equality training for diplomats has been ramped up, with mandatory modules for new staff and specialized training for those in relevant posts[52]. The Ministry has a network of 170 gender focal points across embassies and departments to implement the gender strategy on the ground[53]. This indicates that feminist diplomacy in France is not just a slogan but is translating into bureaucratic processes. France’s new 2025–2030 strategy mandates “collective work” led by the Foreign Ministry across all agencies and “rigorous monitoring” by the independent High Council for Gender Equality[49]. Notably, the High Council (HCE) – an independent body created in 2013 – has been evaluating France’s international gender strategy, providing external oversight[54][55]. In July 2023, the HCE released a first-of-its-kind accountability report on France’s feminist diplomacy, a level of scrutiny that Sweden’s policy also had through annual reports and a published FFP Handbook. These mechanisms suggest an institutional commitment in France to define and measure feminist foreign policy. Furthermore, France plans to host its first “Feminist Foreign Policy Summit” in 2025[56][57], signaling an intent to normatively entrench the concept internationally (previous FFP conferences were held in Germany, Spain, and Mexico in recent years).
However, France’s feminist diplomacy is still on fragile footing institutionally, especially compared to Sweden’s former model. The High Council’s evaluation frankly stated that after five years, French feminist diplomacy “lacks a solid conceptual basis” and has not been clearly defined in official doctrine[25]. Unlike Sweden’s FFP, which was underpinned by a concise handbook outlining objectives and a clear definition of “what FFP means,” France did not even publish an official definition until the new 2025 strategy. The HCE urged France to “define the concept of ‘feminist diplomacy’… in an inclusive manner” as a first step[58]. This implies that within the French government, understanding of FFP may vary, and without a coherent framework, implementation can be patchy. Indeed, analysts note that France’s feminist approach has been uneven across sectors – strong on issues like sexual/reproductive rights and girls’ education, but “absent” or muted in areas like trade, climate, digital, migration, and disarmament[44][46]. For example, France has championed abortion rights at the UN Security Council[15] and led EU negotiations on women’s leadership in corporate boards and pay transparency directives[59]. Yet, France’s feminist lens was less evident in its climate finance (only 18% of France’s climate-marked aid in 2022 went to adaptation, with little gender focus)[60][61] or in trade deals and arms export policies (discussed below). The lack of a whole-of-government gender analysis in these domains points to an institutional gap: feminist principles are not fully internalized across all ministries. Sweden’s FFP, in contrast, required every ambassador and department to apply the “3R+R” framework, from security policy to trade promotion – though even Sweden faced contradictions, it at least had a formal structure compelling cross-government action.
Political support for France’s feminist diplomacy also appears lukewarm at times. The High Council observed that the policy is “too timidly supported politically” and needs firmer commitment from the highest levels[25][58]. President Macron has championed gender equality in speeches (e.g. declaring it a national cause and hosting the Generation Equality Forum), but feminist groups note that day-to-day, the foreign policy establishment has not been radically transformed. By contrast, in Sweden the FFP was an explicit priority of the Foreign Minister and cabinet for 8 years – until a new coalition took power. The Swedish case indeed shows institutional vulnerability: a change of government can overturn a feminist foreign policy overnight. France’s approach could face a similar fate if a less sympathetic administration comes to power (for example, a future government from the conservative or far-right spectrum might abandon the feminist branding just as Sweden’s did). That risk underscores why embedding the policy deeply is crucial. France did at least codify some elements into law (the 2021 development law made gender equality a required objective of aid[21], and in 2024 France even amended its Constitution to entrench abortion rights domestically[62]). Those legal anchors could make it harder – though not impossible – to reverse course. Still, feminist diplomacy is not yet a bipartisan consensus in France. It originated under President Macron’s centrist government; if leadership changes in 2027, the policy’s survival may rely on how institutionalized it has become by then. Currently, it appears to be driven by a relatively small community (the Gender Equality Minister, a dedicated ambassador, and activists like Equipop who co-chaired the HCE commission)[54][63]. The High Council recommended “affirming the government’s commitment at the highest level”, especially in European and international bodies[58] – essentially a call for stronger political backing. Without louder championship by top leaders, France’s FFP could remain tepid and susceptible to policy shifts, undermining its credibility as a sustainable global leader.
Gender balance and personnel within the diplomatic corps form another institutional metric. Here France shows progress but lags behind Sweden. Internally, the French Foreign Ministry has tried to “get its own house in order” on gender parity: as of end 2021, 28% of France’s ambassadors were women, up from just 11% in 2012[64]. France appointed a record 34% women among new ambassadors in 2021[65] and met its legal targets for senior women appointments (around 44% of new senior posts)[66]. Yet women still head only about 39 French embassies worldwide, and top strategic postings remain male-dominated[65][67]. Alice Apostoly of the Gender in Geopolitics Institute notes that “France’s exemplarity is not… respected” in ambassadorial parity – female envoys are rarely sent to the most geopolitically important countries, showing a timid approach to true power-sharing[65][67]. In Sweden, by comparison, women made up 50% or more of ambassadors by recent years[68] – Sweden achieved parity (51% in 2024) in ambassadorial appointments[68], a remarkable statistic that reflects a genuine institutional shift. Other feminist policy adopters like Canada (53% women ambassadors) have similarly outpaced France on this indicator[68]. This matters because feminist foreign policy isn’t just about programs, but also about who represents a country. France still has a heavily male diplomatic corps at senior levels (though half of the Ministry’s total staff are female in junior ranks)[69]. The staffing contradiction is that France touts women’s leadership globally but hasn’t fully achieved it in its own embassies. Moreover, insufficient human resources dedicated specifically to feminist policy have been flagged: the HCE report cited a need for more staffing to implement and coordinate gender strategy across the vast diplomatic network[25]. Without enough gender experts and trained personnel, the policy may not penetrate day-to-day diplomacy. Sweden’s MFA had a dedicated FFP ambassador and integrated FFP duties into every official’s job; Germany’s new FFP roadmap similarly created an Ambassador for FFP and plans to raise “gender-sensitive projects” to 85% by 2025[70][71]. France so far has its Ambassador-at-large for Gender Equality (a post currently held by Delphine O or a successor) and relies on the HCE for oversight, but may consider reinforcing its institutional architecture (e.g. a feminist diplomacy unit or stronger inter-ministerial committee) to truly cement the policy. The bottom line is that France’s feminist diplomacy is still only partially entrenched: it has some institutional pillars, but also clear weaknesses (unclear definition, patchy implementation across sectors, moderate parity progress) that undermine its credibility compared to Sweden’s more systematically implemented (if politically fragile) approach.
Norm-Setting and International Influence: Leadership or Lip Service?
The third dimension is France’s international influence and normative leadership in advancing feminist diplomacy. France has positioned itself as a global champion of women’s rights on the international stage – but its impact is a mix of notable leadership moves and stark contradictions that may erode moral authority.
On the positive side, France has leveraged its diplomatic clout to set global agendas on gender equality. A standout example was the Generation Equality Forum (GEF) in 2021, co-hosted by France and Mexico in partnership with UN Women. This summit rallied governments, NGOs, and philanthropies to pledge an unprecedented $40 billion for gender equality initiatives[38]. France’s leadership of the GEF’s “Bodily Autonomy and SRHR” coalition signaled its commitment to norm-setting in areas like reproductive rights. Indeed, France earned praise for defending sexual and reproductive rights in conservative-dominated arenas: for instance, French diplomats vigorously resisted attempts to remove references to reproductive health in UN Security Council resolutions on women, peace, and security, especially when such pushback came from the U.S. under the previous administration[15]. Diplomatic initiatives during France’s G7 presidency in 2019 (the same year it declared a feminist diplomacy) included launching a “Gender at the Center” initiative to support girls’ education in Africa[72]. France also led EU negotiations on the Women on Boards Directive (to increase women in corporate leadership across Europe) and the EU Pay Transparency Directive[59] – concrete regulatory advances aligned with feminist principles. These efforts show France using its “norm entrepreneur” role in multilateral settings to keep gender equality on the agenda. French influence is also seen in convening coalitions like the “Francophone Feminist Alliance” (planned in the lead-up to the 2024 Francophonie summit) and championing global campaigns (e.g. on women’s suffrage and against online gender-based violence)[20]. All these suggest France is keen to fill the normative void left by Sweden’s exit by being the loudest voice for feminist values internationally.
France’s claim to leadership is bolstered by the growing “Feminist Diplomacy club” of nations in which it now plays a key role. With Sweden’s retreat, countries such as France, Canada, Mexico, Spain, Germany, and Luxembourg have formed a loose alliance advancing feminist foreign policy ideas[73][74]. France has been active in these circles: it will host the next ministerial FFP conference in 2025[16], following Germany (2022), Spain (2023), and Mexico (2024) in organizing high-level meetings to share best practices. French ministers frequently speak about feminist diplomacy in international forums – for example, at the UN General Assembly, France’s foreign minister convened events on defending feminist diplomacy and even proposed adding the right to abortion to the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights[16][75]. Such norm-setting proposals indicate France wants to institutionalize feminist principles at regional and global levels. There’s also evidence that civil society sees France as a potential standard-bearer: when Sweden’s policy ended, women’s rights organizations (e.g. the Feminist Humanitarian Network) publicly “dismayed” by Sweden’s decision called on other countries to “continue the feminist foreign policy movement”[76]. France’s response – updating its strategy and doubling funding – aligns with answering that call. In the EU context, France and like-minded states are pushing back against an anti-rights backlash in some countries[44][45]. This highlights France’s role in alliances (such as the SheDecides initiative to fund reproductive health, which France champions[77]) and in norm diffusion (encouraging more states to adopt feminist policies or at least gender-focused programs).
However, France’s international feminist influence is undercut by notable contradictions and realpolitik that can appear hypocritical. The most glaring contradiction is France’s arms exports and military partnerships, which clash with feminist principles of peace and human security. France is one of the world’s top arms exporters – ranked 3rd globally, accounting for 11% of global arms exports in 2017–2021[78]. Even as France preaches women’s rights, it has continued to sell weapons to regimes with poor records on gender and human rights. On average, over 25% of French arms exports go to Saudi Arabia and the UAE[78], two countries deeply implicated in the Yemen conflict (dubbed the world’s worst humanitarian crisis for women and children). French weapons – from fighter jets to munitions – have been used in Yemen, where they undoubtedly have harmed civilians, “including women, children and girls”[79][80]. As Alice Apostoly bluntly states, “France is known for its feminist diplomacy, but also for its arms trade. This is a major source of contradiction. Our trade policy does not have a gender perspective”[79][80]. Indeed, feminist foreign policy inherently calls for disarmament and restraint, recognizing the link between arms and gender-based violence. Yet France’s arms exports surged by 59% in recent years[81][82], and it even initiated new nuclear weapons programs in 2021[78][83]. This undermines France’s credibility: can France truly claim to advance a “feminist” vision of global security while profiting from arms sales that fuel wars and repression? Sweden faced the same critique – its own OECD review noted Sweden’s high arms exports to authoritarian regimes were inconsistent with its FFP[84]. But Sweden at least made some corrections (e.g. revoking a Saudi arms deal in 2015 on human rights grounds). France has been far more reluctant to curb arms sales in the name of human rights, given the economic and strategic interests at play. This strategic contradiction sends mixed signals to partners and activists. For example, Germany’s feminist foreign minister faced backlash for not supporting a Gaza ceasefire due to strategic alliances[85]; similarly, France’s close ties with regimes like Egypt or Saudi Arabia can dilute its moral authority to lecture on women’s rights. Feminist activists, especially in the Global South, notice these double standards: “Western feminist foreign policy should not be packaged as saving us… while [being] silent on uncomfortable issues” like arms and racial justice, warns Ugandan feminist Rosebell Kagumire[86][87]. Thus, France’s normative leadership is credible when it advocates rights, but it is not credible if it ignores its own contradictions in areas like arms trading and security policy.
Another area of inconsistency is France’s stance on global women’s economic justice. While France pushes gender equality in political representation, critics point out it has been less vocal on feminist approaches to trade and economic policy. For instance, France strongly supports women entrepreneurs and education abroad, but its trade policies (e.g. EU trade agreements) rarely undergo a feminist impact assessment. There’s no explicit “feminist trade policy” from France that addresses how trade liberalization or supply chains affect women – a gap that feminist economists highlight[88]. In contrast, countries like Canada and Sweden began exploring feminist international trade approaches (e.g. gender chapters in trade deals). Similarly, on migration and asylum, France’s policies (such as strict border controls in the Mediterranean) have not been framed through a feminist lens, even though migrant women face distinct vulnerabilities. Such omissions mean France isn’t consistently using its influence to apply feminist principles across all international issues, focusing mainly on the “softer” social sectors. To France’s credit, its 2025 strategy explicitly calls for broadening into “sectors currently absent such as environment, trade, digital, migration, and disarmament”[44][46]. This is effectively an admission that France must expand its norm-setting beyond traditional gender arenas. How well it does so will affect its leadership credibility. A holistic feminist foreign policy would mean France speaking up on, for example, women’s land rights in climate action, or the gendered impact of refugee crises – not just on topics like sexual violence where it already leads.
Finally, consider France’s influence in terms of alliances and reception by other countries. France has the advantage of being a UN Security Council permanent member and a leading EU power, which Sweden was not. This gives France a larger platform to institutionalize norms (e.g. proposing resolutions, funding UN programs). However, with that status comes scrutiny. Countries in the Global South sometimes view France’s feminist diplomacy with skepticism, worrying it could be a vehicle for neo-colonial lecturing or selective concern. For example, African feminists caution that Western nations might use “feminist foreign policy” to impose their agendas while ignoring racial and economic injustices[86]. France’s complex post-colonial relationships in Africa mean it must exercise careful, genuine partnership – supporting local women’s movements (which it does via the FSOF) rather than appearing as a savior. The credibility test is whether France’s feminist diplomacy can be inclusive and coalition-building, rather than top-down. In this regard, France has worked with UN Women and civil society in co-designing initiatives, and it stresses that civil society is the “true architect” of feminist diplomacy[16][89]. That rhetoric is promising. Still, if France is seen as pursuing feminist diplomacy only when it aligns with Western liberal values, but not when inconvenient (e.g. not condemning allies’ abuses, or cutting aid when domestic budgets tighten), its international influence could ring hollow. On the other hand, if France follows through – e.g. by funding the new Global Alliance for Women’s Health or similar efforts to close gaps in women’s health and education – it can fill the void left by Sweden and push the global norm forward. (Notably, the World Economic Forum’s new Global Women’s Health Alliance highlights that women’s health is underfunded worldwide, with a ~$1 trillion annual economic opportunity if the gap is closed[90][91]. France’s feminist diplomacy could gain credibility by championing such issues of financing the gender gaps in health, rather than focusing only on high-level conferences.)
Conclusion: A Leader in Name, but Will Practice Catch Up?
In summary, France has eagerly stepped into a leadership role in global feminist diplomacy after Sweden’s withdrawal – hosting summits, funding women’s organizations, and advocating women’s rights in international forums. France’s official commitments on paper are highly progressive, even visionary, in line with what a “global leader” would proclaim. However, the credibility of France’s leadership is a mixed picture. There are clear strengths: France backs feminist diplomacy with some real resources (e.g. €250 million fund, nearly half of aid now gender-tagged) and has embedded it in strategies and institutions (cross-cutting government plan, independent evaluations, diplomatic training). France’s influence is also notable – rallying $40 billion in global commitments[38], standing firm on issues like abortion rights, and keeping the feminist diplomacy coalition alive post-Sweden. These actions underscore that France is serious about being seen as the new standard-bearer of feminist foreign policy.
Yet, contradictions and gaps temper this credibility. Funding falls short of rhetoric: France is not yet meeting its own targets for feminist aid, and recent ODA cuts send the wrong signal[29][32]. Institutionally, France’s feminist policy is not fully entrenched – it lacks a consistent framework and robust political backing, raising doubts about its longevity and depth[25][44]. Internationally, France’s moral authority is compromised by policies at odds with feminist ideals, most notably its lucrative arms exports that fuel conflicts harming women[79][78]. As one expert put it, “voluntarist diplomacy has to contend with the strategic interests of states”[92] – and France has not resolved that tension. For France to be a credible global leader in feminist diplomacy, it will need to better “move from words to deeds” (to quote the High Council report’s title) by closing the gaps between its lofty commitments and implementation. That means increasing and ring-fencing budgets for gender equality, solidifying institutional mandates, ensuring consistency (no feminist policy in one hand and arms deals in the other), and truly championing gender justice even when politically inconvenient. France’s new 2025–2030 strategy acknowledges these challenges and sets “increasingly ambitious” goals[93] – the real test will be in execution and whether those ambitions survive the shifting winds of politics.
As of now, France’s leadership is credible in intent and ambition, but not yet in comprehensive practice. It is, in effect, a leader by default after Sweden – striving to prove that a liberal great power can wear the feminist diplomacy mantle sincerely. The coming years (with France hosting a global FFP summit in 2025 and pushing its 75% gender-aid target by 2025) will be pivotal. France could solidify its role as the champion of feminist foreign policy if it addresses its contradictions. It has the diplomatic influence, and it’s begun to put money where its mouth is; bridging the remaining gaps would turn France’s feminist diplomacy from a bold vision into a tangible reality that others can trust and emulate[94][95]. The world is watching to see if France truly “steps up its action amid rising anti-rights movements”[96] – or if feminist diplomacy will remain more rhetoric than reform. For now, the jury is still out, and France’s credibility hangs in the balance between its promises and its practices.
