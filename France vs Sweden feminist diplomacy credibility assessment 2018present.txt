France vs Sweden feminist diplomacy credibility assessment,
2018–present
Full search query: I want to find an in-depth assessment of France’s credibility as the leading actor in global feminist diplomacy in the aftermath
of Sweden’s withdrawal, centered on 2018–present, that (a) compares France to Sweden (with optional reference to other FFP-claimant states as
needed), (b) identifies contradictions between France’s official feminist foreign policy commitments and practice across funding, institutional depth,
and international influence, including evidence on ODA gender allocations and disbursements, formal mandates and accountability versus ad hoc
initiatives, and norm entrepreneurship and coalition-building, and (c) examines coherence across salient policy arenas—such as arms exports,
migration/asylum, SRHR and laïcité, and Francophone Africa/Sahel—to evaluate whether France’s claimed leadership is substantively warranted

Summary
France’s post2018 “feminist diplomacy” is well documented as a leadershiporiented narrative with strong multilateral visibility but thin
empirical substantiation on funding, accountability, and crossarena coherence relative to Sweden’s benchmark institutionalization,
meaning current sources support a cautious, partial credibility claim rather than a substantiated leadership verdict [1,2,3,4,5].

Evidence base and key gaps
• What is available:
• Comparative framing and strategic narratives placing France alongside Sweden, Canada, and Mexico; France’s pillars,
targets, and multilateral anchoring are described [1,5].
• Interview evidence on how France selfpositions (parity, UNSC seat, convening capacity) and how peers perceive its
leadership claims [2].
• Sweden’s deep institutionalization and “stickiness” post2022 withdrawal, providing a robust benchmark for comparison
[4,10].
• A postcolonial case study exposing rhetoric–practice contradictions in France’s handling of SEA in the CAR, relevant to
credibility and accountability [3].
• What is missing for France:
• Disbursementlevel ODA series (2018–present) with DAC gender markers, principal vs significant shares, grant/loan
composition, and sectoral breakdowns [1,5,9].
• Evidence of binding, timebound targets with independent audits; crossministerial constraints linking gender to arms, trade,
and migration decisions [1,2,5,9].
• Systematic Francespecific coherence analysis across arms exports, migration/asylum, SRHR and laïcité, and Sahel/Francophone Africa beyond the single CAR case [1,2,3,5,8].

Comparative positioning: France versus Sweden
• Sweden as benchmark:
• Prewithdrawal FFP integrated across MFA–development cooperation with high transparency; 79% of bilateral aid
(2009–2014) tagged significant/principal for gender; nonetheless, trade and militaryexport regulation largely escaped
gender integration [4].
• Post2022 label retraction likely reduces leadership signaling but practices remain “sticky” due to international norms and
decentralized implementation [4,10].
• France’s profile:
• Frames “feminist diplomacy” around parity, legal/rights feminism, and global convening; emphasizes four pillars (ending
GBV, equitable education/health, women’s economic empowerment, gender parity) and multilateral roles (G7 2019;
Generation Equality Forum 2021) [1,5].
• Peers see France foregrounding geopolitical reach and event capacity rather than development performance, producing
mixed perceptions of substantive leadership [2].
• Implication:
• Compared to Sweden’s documented institutional depth and aid tagging, France’s leadership claim rests more on narrative
prominence and diplomacy than on transparent, audited practice across funding and policy arenas [1,2,3,4,5].

Funding and ODA: allocations, modalities, and transparency

REPORT CREATED ON

France’s “genderfocused” aid cited at 28% versus a 38% OECD average (period unspecified); AFD reported aiming for
gender components in 50% of projects [1].
• France’s rhetoric has included pledges like “50% of development aid projects will reduce gender inequality” during
reputational crises [3].
• Evidence constraints:
• No disbursementlevel time series, principal vs significant shares, or grant/loan composition provided in these sources;
Sweden’s comparative data (79% significant/principal 2009–2014) is stronger [1,4,9].
• Reading:
• Available figures for France are indicative but insufficient to assess whether resources substantively match leadership
claims or exceed Sweden’s benchmark [1,4,9].

Institutionalization and accountability
• France:
• Institutional steps include a Secretariat of Equality, parity objectives, and AFD gender mainstreaming guidance [1].
• Interview data suggests France highlights its diplomatic network and parity brand, but sources do not document binding,
timebound targets or independent evaluations constraining security/trade/migration decisions [2,5,9].
• Sweden:
• Mixedmethods evidence details wholeofgovernment integration and internal steering documents, combined with recognized domain gaps (trade/arms) [4].
• Credibility inference:
• France’s institutional architecture appears thinner and less externally audited than Sweden’s prior model, weakening
claims of comparative leadership on institutional depth [1,4,5,9].

International influence: norm entrepreneurship and coalitions
• France’s strengths:
• Prominent convening and agendasetting roles: G7 (2019), cohosting the Generation Equality Forum (Paris 2021),
anchoring in WPS/SDGs; FFP framed as bulwark against illiberalism [1,5].
• Selfpositioning as a “top spatial actor” leveraging UNSC role and a large network; interviewees confirm France prioritizes
global/regional leadership as a scarce attribute [2].
• Caveats:
• Scholarship notes reputational branding functions and postcolonial critiques—leadership claims may oversignal modernity
while masking accountability gaps [3,5].
• Comparative takeaway:
• France’s norm entrepreneurship is visible and consequential, but influence claims require followthrough evidence on
commitments and delivery to warrant “leading actor” status [1,2,3,5].

Policy coherence checks across salient arenas
• Arms exports:
• Within this set, armsexport coherence is well documented for Sweden (contradictions between progressive brand
and defense industry), offering an analytical template [4,6]; Francespecific export destinations/enduse visàvis feminist
commitments are not empirically assessed here [1,2,3,5].
• Migration/asylum:
• Intersections are treated conceptually in forum literature [8]; Francespecific practice since 2018 is not analyzed in these
sources.
• SRHR and laïcité:
• SRHR appears in France’s pillars and Sahel priorities [1,2,5], but delivery data (e.g., abortion access/CSE programming,
instrument modalities) and laïcité’s external partnership effects are absent.
• Francophone Africa/Sahel:
• The CAR case study shows feminist rhetoric used for nation branding amid accountability failures [3]; wider Sahel/Francophonie coherence linking security posture to continuity of women’s rights programs or coalitionbuilding is not
systematically assessed [1,2,3].

• Substantive warrant for France’s claimed leadership:
• Current literature supports France’s prominence in narrative and norm entrepreneurship but does not provide the funding
evidence, institutional accountability, or crossarena coherence needed to substantiate a superior leadership claim over
Sweden’s legacy or other FFP states [1,2,3,4,5,9].
• Sweden’s withdrawal creates a signaling vacuum, yet its documented institutional “stickiness” and aid benchmarks remain
a high bar; France’s credibility rests on converting visibility into audited practice and coherent policy across hardsecurity
and migration domains [4,10].
• Research and data priorities:
• Compile France’s 2018–present ODA gendermarker disbursement series, grant/loan shares, and sectoral allocations;
assess AFD project tagging against principal versus significant targets [1,9].
• Map formal mandates, timebound targets, and independent evaluations across MFA, AFD, defense/export control, and
interior/migration ministries; identify crossministerial coherence mechanisms [1,2,5,9].
• Conduct Francespecific coherence audits in arms exports (deliveries/enduse to conflict contexts), migration/asylum
externalization, SRHR programming under laïcité constraints, and Sahel engagements, with attention to coalitionbuilding
and norm diffusion [3,6,8].

REPORT CREATED ON
25/10/2025

• France: 28% of aid reported as “gender-focused” vs OECD average 38% (period not specified in the excerpt) [1].
• AFD/France: aim to include a gender component in 50% of projects (stated target) [1]. A similar pledge (“50% of
development aid projects will reduce gender inequality”) is cited in France’s discourse during the CAR SEA crisis [3].
• Sweden: 79% of bilateral aid (2009–2014) tagged as “significant” or “principal” for gender [4].
• Leadership/norm entrepreneurship roles:
• France: G7 2019 presidency engagement; co-lead/host of Generation Equality Forum (Paris 2021); anchoring in
SDGs/WPS [1,5].
• France self-positioning: parity focus, large diplomatic network, UNSC role, Sahel priorities; emphasis on capacity to launch
initiatives; peers’ mixed perceptions of France’s leadership claims [2].
• Institutionalization depth:
• France: creation of Secretariat of Equality; parity targets linked to the Sauvadet Act; ministry-level parity objectives; AFD
mainstreaming steps [1].
• Sweden: whole-of-government integration under FFP with documented stickiness and identified gaps in trade/military
export gendering [4].

What each paper uniquely contributes to the France leadership question
• [1] Zhukova et al. 2021:
• Positions France’s “feminist diplomacy” in relation to Sweden’s benchmark and Canada’s development focus; supplies
concrete pillars, institutional measures, and two quantitative signposts (28% gender-focused aid; 50% AFD gender-component target) [1].
• Useful as an early baseline of France’s narrative architecture and targets; limited on disbursements/modality or coherence
audits.
• [2] Zhukova 2023:
• Provides rare interview-based evidence on how French diplomats and peers rank and perceive “leadership,” highlighting
France’s emphasis on geopolitical reach and initiative-launching capacity, and others’ ambivalence or critique [2].
• Illuminates norm competition and “hegemonic feminisation” dynamics—valuable for assessing credibility beyond inputs/outputs.
• [3] Holmes & White 2023:
• In-depth case showing how “feminist diplomacy” is mobilized for nation-branding during a reputational crisis (CAR SEA),
documenting rhetoric–practice contradictions and accountability gaps [3].
• Postcolonial lens connects to Francophone Africa dynamics; does not generalize across other arenas or provide
ODA/funding data.
• [4] Towns et al. 2024:
• High-quality empirical assessment of Sweden’s institutionalization, with quantitative aid tagging and identification of
domains where FFP had limited reach (trade/arms), enabling a robust comparative benchmark for France [4].
• Crucial for calibrating expectations after Sweden’s label withdrawal (stickiness), but lacks France-specific evidence.
• [5] Thomson 2022:
• Situates France within FFP’s genealogy and notes its newer, less document-rich status; flags France’s co-hosting of
Generation Equality Forum and liberal-norm signaling; raises postcolonial cautions [5].
• Conceptual framing that underscores risks of hierarchy reproduction, pertinent to France’s Sahel/Francophonie posture.
• [6] Coetzee et al. 2023:
• Demonstrates how a “progressive” national brand can coexist with and legitimize arms exports (Sweden), offering an
analytical template to scrutinize France’s similar coherence tensions even though France is not assessed here [6].
• [7] Mirje & Girija 2024:
• Compares incorporation of the Women-and-Peace hypothesis across four FFPs; finds France and Mexico emphasize
broader empowerment over conflict-negotiation participation [7].
• Adds a thematic comparative angle but not funding/institutional/coherence evidence.
• [8] Achilleos-Sarll et al. 2022:
• Forum mapping FFP’s intersections with migration, militarism, and bodies; offers conceptual hooks to evaluate France’s
cross-arena coherence [8].
• [9] Hicks 2021:
• High-level comparative take noting differential scope (France on development assistance and formal diplomacy; Sweden
more comprehensive), and observes weak evaluation evidence overall [9].

• [10] Elgström & Rosén Sundström 2025:
• Sweden/EU-focused argument on normative leadership loss post-FFP; helps contextualize the “vacuum” that France might
claim to fill, but does not assess France [10].

Alignment with your evidence needs: where the literature is strong vs thin
• Strong or partly covered:
• International influence and norm entrepreneurship: France’s role in G7/GEF, UNSC, and leadership self-framing; external
perceptions via interviews [1,2,5].
• Sweden as benchmark for institutionalization depth and post-2022 “stickiness” of practices [4,10].
• Rhetoric–practice contradictions in a Francophone Africa case (CAR SEA) with postcolonial critique [3].
• Thin or missing for a robust France leadership audit:
• Funding detail: No paper provides France’s disbursement-level ODA series by DAC gender marker over 2018–present,
breakdown of principal vs significant gender objectives, grant/loan composition, or sectoral allocations; only headline
figures/targets appear [1,3].
• Institutional accountability: Lack of analysis of binding, time-bound targets, independent audits, cross-ministerial constraints that would cover arms/trade/migration in France; most evidence is descriptive [1,2,5,9].
• Policy coherence arenas (France-specific):
• Arms exports: No empirical assessment of France’s export decisions, destinations, or end-use vis-à-vis feminist
commitments in this set [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10].
• Migration/asylum and externalization: Conceptually discussed in forum pieces but not assessed for France’s
2018–present policy practice [8].
• SRHR and laïcité: SRHR appears in France’s pillars; there is no evidence on programmatic delivery, contentious
areas (abortion/CSE), or laïcité-related diplomatic impacts [1,2,5].
• Francophone Africa/Sahel beyond the CAR case: No systematic link between security posture, coups/backsliding,
and continuity of gender programs or coalition-building [1,2,3].
• Comparative France–Sweden synthesis:
• Available: Sweden’s high institutionalization and aid gender-tagging; France’s leadership branding, targets, and event
diplomacy [1,2,4,5].
• Missing: Direct, data-driven France–Sweden comparison on ODA disbursements post-2018, institutional mandates with
external accountability, and cross-arena coherence metrics (especially arms/migration/SRHR).

Practical takeaways for an expert assessment using these sources
• Use [4] as the benchmark for the Sweden side (institutional depth, aid tagging, and domain gaps), and [1,2,5] to reconstruct
France’s institutional narrative, targets, and norm-entrepreneurship positioning.
• Leverage [3] to evidence rhetoric–practice gaps and postcolonial tensions in a salient Francophone context; use [6] to frame
a methodology for interrogating arms-export coherence (though France-specific data will need to be sourced elsewhere).
• Treat the quantitative claims about France’s ODA as indicative, not definitive: the 28% figure and 50% project-target are reported
but not tied to time series, disbursements, or modality/sector breakdowns [1,3].
• Expect that the set does not, on its own, allow a conclusive judgment on whether France’s leadership claim is substantively
warranted across funding, institutional accountability, and cross-arena coherence. It supports a cautious, partial assessment
centered on narrative leadership and perceived status, with identified credibility gaps to be filled by additional data collection.

Timeline
Milestones and policy timeline (2014–2025)
• 2014: Sweden launches the first explicit Feminist Foreign Policy (FFP), establishing the benchmark for institutionalization and
transparency across foreign policy domains [4,6].
• 2018: France formalizes “feminist diplomacy” via its International Strategy on Gender Equality (2018–2022), linking to WPS
and SDGs, and positions itself as a multilateral norm entrepreneur [1,5].
• 2019: France leverages its G7 presidency and parity/rights-focused agenda, and advances development-assistance mainstreaming targets (e.g., 50% of AFD projects to include a gender component), consolidating its branding as a global leader
[1,3].
• 2021: Generation Equality Forum in Paris co-hosted by France and Mexico; France’s leadership role in convening coalitions is
foregrounded, with normative signaling strengthened but questions about follow-through persist in subsequent scholarship [5].

REPORT CREATED ON
25/10/2025

Late 2022: Sweden retracts the FFP label; scholarship documents the depth of pre-existing institutionalization and the probable
“stickiness” of practices despite political reversal, reconfiguring the leadership landscape and implicitly elevating France’s claims
[4].
• 2023: Research turns to competitive claims of leadership and symbolic hierarchies among FFP states, with France’s self-positioning around parity, multilateral reach, and Sahel priorities scrutinized; parallel work interrogates branding and contradictions
in Nordic (Swedish) security exports [2,6].
• 2023: Case study of France’s diplomatic response to SEA in CAR exposes tensions between feminist rhetoric, colonial legacies,
and accountability gaps, offering a cautionary lens on reputational leadership tactics [3].
• 2024–2025: Post-retraction syntheses of Sweden’s FFP and EU gender leadership map the implications of Sweden’s label
withdrawal and continuing normative roles; France’s comparative standing is referenced but not fully empirically adjudicated in
terms of funding, institutional depth, and coherence [4,10].

Evolution of scholarly concepts and approaches
• Strategic narratives and norm translation:
• Early comparative work frames FFPs as strategic narratives that translate gender norms differently across national
contexts; France is characterized by rights/legal feminism, parity, and multilateral performance, contrasted with Sweden’s
comprehensive, whole-of-government FFP [1].
• Subsequent analyses theorize FFP as signaling liberal modernity and “relevance,” emphasizing its genealogy in WPS/Beijing/SDGs and raising postcolonial critiques relevant to France’s engagements in the Sahel and Francophonie [5].
• Hierarchies and hegemonic feminisation:
• Interviews across FFP states articulate a competitive field of “hegemonic feminisation,” where France foregrounds global
leadership capacity and event convening as comparative advantages, while peers question substantive depth and
domestic consistency; Sweden’s earlier benchmark status shapes perceived rankings [2].
• Branding, reputational management, and contradictions:
• Studies on Sweden’s security branding expose how progressive nation images coexist with arms-export practices, a
framework directly relevant to evaluating France’s coherence claims in arms and security domains [6].
• Discourse analyses of France’s CAR SEA crisis show feminist diplomacy employed as reputational repair, revealing
disjunctures between rhetorical leadership and accountability—informing assessments of France’s credibility as a norm
entrepreneur [3].
• FFP “stickiness” and resilience:
• Mixed-methods work on Sweden’s retraction theorizes institutional “stickiness” due to international norms, decentralized
implementation, and entrenched expectations—suggesting that label changes (Sweden) or branding emphasis (France)
may not fully capture practice continuity or depth [4].
• Policy intersections:
• Cross-cutting reviews emphasize FFP’s engagement with migration, militarism, and bodies, but note limited empirical testing of policy coherence—an analytical gap for France’s claims across arms exports, SRHR, laïcité, and migration/asylum
[8].
• Focused assessments of the Women and Peace Hypothesis find France prioritizes broad empowerment over women’s
participation in peace negotiations, contrasting with Sweden/Canada’s stronger WPS incorporation [7].

Methodological trends and evidence bases
• Predominant methods:
• Document and discourse analysis of official strategies, speeches, and diplomatic communications to map narratives,
commitments, and framing [1,3,5].
• Semi-structured elite interviews to capture self-positioning, competitive hierarchies, and insider perceptions of leadership
and implementation [2].
• Mixed methods combining surveys, interviews, and internal government documents to assess institutionalization depth
and post-label practice continuity (primarily for Sweden) [4].
• Thematic and forum-style syntheses that chart intersections (migration, militarism, climate), often conceptual rather than
data-heavy [8].
• Evidence limitations relevant to assessing France’s leadership:
• Scarcity of granular ODA gender-disbursement analyses for France, including sectoral breakdowns and grant-versus-loan
composition; available figures commonly reference OECD gender markers in aggregate without disbursement modalities
or accountability audits [1,5,9].
• Thin cross-ministerial coherence testing with respect to arms exports, migration/asylum, and laïcité’s external impacts;
case studies illustrate rhetorical gaps but do not offer systematic outcome metrics [3,6].
• Comparative France–Sweden assessments often lean on narrative and institutional history rather than comparable
funding datasets and external evaluations; post-2022 literature centers on Sweden’s retraction more than France’s
substantive practice [4,10].

Key contributors and collaborative clusters
• Comparative FFP and norm translation cluster:
• E. Zhukova and Ole Elgström participate in comparative and conceptual work on strategic narratives and later on
EU/Sweden gender leadership, establishing a thread from early cross-country comparisons to post-retraction analyses
[1,10].
• J. Thomson synthesizes FFP’s evolution in norms literature, highlighting signaling and hierarchy—useful for situating
France’s leadership claims in global context [5].
• Achilleos-Sarll and collaborators curate broader forum contributions on FFP’s intersections, expanding conceptual breadth
while underscoring empirical gaps [8].
• Leadership competition and hierarchy:
• Zhukova’s solo work on “hegemonic feminisation” provides interview-based, insider perspectives on how France portrays
and ranks itself within the FFP community, informing leadership credibility assessments [2].
• Branding and reputational analysis:
• Holmes and White deploy feminist postcolonial discourse analysis to interrogate France’s crisis response and nation-branding, directly relevant to evaluating credibility versus performance [3].
• Coetzee and colleagues analyze Sweden’s progressive security brand and arms export contradictions, offering a
transferable framework to assess France’s coherence in hard-security domains [6].
• Institutionalization and resilience of FFP:
• Towns, Bjarnegård, and co-authors provide a rigorous, mixed-methods window into Sweden’s FFP depth, targets,
and implementation challenges—defining a benchmark against which France’s institutional depth and accountability
mechanisms can be compared [4].
• Policy intersections and WPS focus:
• Mirje and Girija compare four FFPs on the Women and Peace Hypothesis, locating France’s emphasis on empowerment
over peace-process participation, which bears on claims of leadership in WPS-focused arenas [7].

Emerging patterns and implications for future research
• Shift from Sweden-centric to competitive leadership narratives:
• As Sweden withdraws the FFP label, scholarship pivots to how states—especially France—claim leadership via multilateral convening and parity rhetoric; yet empirical tests of funding and coherence lag behind narrative analyses [2,4,5,10].
• Persistent gaps in practice-based evaluation:
• Across the literature, there is limited systematic evidence on France’s ODA gender allocations/disbursements by sector
and instrument, and sparse external accountability assessments—key to validating leadership claims against Sweden’s
prior benchmark [1,5,9].
• Growing attention to contradictions:
• Branding and postcolonial critiques highlight tensions between rhetoric and practice (e.g., security exports, crisis
response), suggesting that future work should prioritize cross-ministerial coherence assessments and end-use/impact
analyses in conflict-affected settings [3,6,8].
• Anticipated directions:
• Comparative, data-rich studies that integrate OECD-DAC markers with disbursement, modality (grants/loans), sectoral
detail, and independent evaluation are needed to adjudicate France’s leadership relative to Sweden’s legacy and other
FFP adopters [4,5,8].
• Researchers connected to the existing comparative and norms clusters (e.g., Zhukova, Elgström, Towns, Thomson) may
extend analyses to France-focused funding and accountability datasets, while feminist security and postcolonial scholars
(e.g., Holmes, White) can deepen coherence evaluations in arms, migration/asylum, and Sahel engagements [2,3,4,5,6].

[12] Spreading a norm-based policy? Sweden’s Feminist Foreign Policy in international media
M. Sundström, ..., and Ole Elgström. Contemporary Politics, 2021. 15 citations.
0% Topic Match
Abstract: ABSTRACT Since 2014, Sweden has pursued the world's first Feminist Foreign Policy (FFP). However, the effectiveness of its policy promotion depends
on how Sweden's efforts to spread this norm-based policy are perceived and evaluated by other states. We argue that a policy promotion effort has to be perceived
as legitimate, coherent and salient by target populations in order to be effective. We investigate the extent to which it is the case in national newspapers of 17
countries, representing world and regional powers. We demonstrate that most coverage of the FFP is rather modest, notably in non-Western countries. Further, we
argue...

Abstract: An increased emphasis on gender equality in the EU’s foreign and security policy could potentially pave the way for a Feminist Foreign Policy (FFP) for
the EU. Analysing the perceptions of Sweden’s FFP in newspapers of eleven EU Member States, this article contributes to the literature on norm enhancement –
advancing the depth and scope of the existing norms in an area – as well as to the discussion on Member States’ views of FFP and the potential for introducing a
FFP into EU foreign policy. Studying salience, (in)coherence and legitimacy of Sweden’s FFP in newspapers, the results demonstrate that...

Abstract: As the first country in the world, Sweden introduced its Feminist Foreign Policy (FFP) in 2014. The article investigates how Sweden's FFP is communicated
in quality newspapers in 11 EU Member States (2014–2020). It focuses on whether the coverage of FFP signals the adoption of media logic or political logic, and
whether the newspapers’ images of FFP serve to strengthen or counteract the existing tendencies on gender equality in the different Member States. The findings
demonstrate that reports on FFP are heavily influenced by media logic. They give priority to political conflicts and focus on short-term events and persons rather...

Abstract: ABSTRACT Sweden describes its feminist foreign policy (FFP) as strategically illuminating structures of gender inequality by incorporating a feminist
perspective in all areas of foreign policy, analytically and practically. This study scrutinizes the transformative potential of Sweden’s FFP discourse. Feminist
scholarship argues for recognizing interrelations between gender and postcolonial structures; stressing gender hierarchies as contextual and contingent on various
power structures. Using critical discourse analysis, we analyze documents, statements and speeches produced within the Swedish FFP in relation to postcolonial
feminist theory. We find that a large part of the Swedish FFP discourse reproduces essentialist discourse informed by colonial legacies,...

Abstract: Canadian federal governments regularly try to craft a unique image of Canada in the world; however, the Trudeau government’s embrace of feminist foreign
policy feels strikingly similar to the late 1990s when human security was embraced. There seems to be a “sameness” in the promotion of a progressive values-based
discourse that has transformative potential for Canadian foreign policy. The question is, does this sense of sameness bear out when we dig into the comparison?
Drawing on speeches given by government ministers; policy documents, such as the Feminist International Assistance Policy (FIAP); media; and scholarship, we
compare and contrast analyses of...

Abstract: Gender justice and equality have risen to prominence in the constitution of foreign and security policy. This article locates the analysis of feminist
foreign policy (FFP) within the wider context of Sweden's state feminist tradition as well as its pursuit of “gender cosmopolitanism” in global politics. Both “gender
cosmopolitanism” and Sweden's state feminist tradition provided fertile ground for the formal adoption of FFP in 2014. The article employs poststructural discursive
techniques that enable the identification of the statist feminist and cosmopolitan foundations of feminist foreign policy. More specifically, the article provides a
discursive analysis of the ethical and feminist ambitions,...

Abstract: ABSTRACT The policy documents of the European Union underline its self-image as a leader in promoting and protecting human rights in multilateral fora.
The leadership claims are based on the EU’s example in domestic human rights protection and willingness to promote externally the same set of values and norms.
However, drawing on interactionist role theory, this article emphasises the extent to which the roles depend on recognition by others. Hence, leadership claims need
acceptance from other stakeholders. The article studies external perceptions of EU’s leadership in the Human Rights Council framework using data from interviews

Abstract: Sweden’s feminist foreign policy is founded on the broad idea that gender equality is central to security. This article focuses on how the politicisation of
this gender-security nexus is discursively articulated and practiced in the case of feminist foreign policy. The problematic is unpacked by analysing the politicisation
of the women, peace and security agenda and global gender mainstreaming. To empirically illustrate the gender-security nexus more specifically, we analyse how
these politicisation processes are reflected in Sweden’s support for global peace diplomacy and gender protection. The article concludes by offering three final
remarks. First, Sweden’s feminist foreign policy is an...

Abstract: A growing number of states are adopting a feminist foreign policy (FFP). While this change has excited much scholarly attention, the process by which
countries decide to adopt FFP remains unclear: How can we explain their journey toward the formal adoption of FFP? What factors create an environment in which
these states were willing (and able) to declare their foreign policy feminist? We bring together literature on FFP and foreign policy change to identify the factors that
lead to the uptake of FFP. The roles of a favorable domestic context, policy entrepreneurs, a new governing coalition, and the international...

Abstract: Across politics and public discourse, feminism is experiencing a global renaissance. Yet feminist academic work is divided over the burgeoning use of the
term, particularly in reference to economic and international development policy. For some, feminism has been co-opted for neoliberal economic ends; for others, it
remains a critical force across the globe. This article explores the nascent feminist foreign policies of Sweden and Canada. Employing a discourse analysis of both
states’ policy documents, it asks what the term “feminist” meant in preliminary attempts at constructing a feminist foreign policy. It argues that although both use the
term “feminist,”...

Abstract: ABSTRACT The state-sponsored recruitment of migrant healthcare workers from the global South into the global North is a contemporary practice that
requires critical engagement. Germany, like many other like-minded countries, has developed its own recruitment program Triple Win which aims to sustainably and

that reproduce the program as a practice in neocolonial care extractivism. This lack of awareness is set against the country’s promotion of a feminist foreign and

Abstract: ABSTRACT Drawing on a postcolonial perspective and theories of strategic narratives and silences, this article looks at how Sweden’s feminist foreign
policy (FFP) was reported in the media of conflict-affected states. It improves our understanding of feminist foreign policy reception by showing that from twenty
selected countries, only newspapers in ten states had content on the FFP. It is argued that this modest media coverage was guided by a lack of interest in the FFP
expressed in silence as an indirect way of resistance to norm promotion. This lack of interest is conceptualised as a postcolonial disengagement with Sweden’s

[28] Incredibly loud and extremely silent: Feminist foreign policy on Twitter
K. Jezierska. Cooperation and Conflict, 2021. 20 citations.

Abstract: In 2014, Sweden’s Feminist Foreign Policy (FFP) was announced with a fanfare. This article critically interrogates how Sweden implements the FFP through
digital diplomacy by investigating the extent of Sweden’s gender equality activities on Twitter since the introduction of the FFP and by tracing gendered online abuse
in digital diplomacy. I focus on Swedish embassy tweets towards two countries where feminism is highly contested – Poland and Hungary. The theoretical inspiration
comes from discursive approaches to the spoken and unspoken, enriched by feminist observations about the non-binary character of voice/silence. The method
applied is gender-driven quantitative and qualitative content analysis....

[31] Swedish Foreign Policy Feminisms: Women, Social Democracy and Capitalism
Leila Brännström and Markus Gunneflo. Australian Feminist Law Journal, 2021. 5 citations.
0% Topic Match
Abstract: ABSTRACT This article outlines the historical distinctiveness of the feminist foreign policy (FFP) Sweden has pursued since 2014. To highlight the
particularity of the current FFP, we make use of two methodological moves: de-framing and counterpoint. De-framing helps us highlight the importance for the
current FFP of a moment in the beginning of the 1990s, when a feminism naturalising capitalist arrangements came to ascendency both transnationally and in
Sweden. Counterpoint entails juxtaposing the present FFP with a decidedly different Swedish FFP project from the late 1960s and 1970s – the project of the
prominent Social Democrat Birgitta Dahl to gain...

Abstract: ABSTRACT The self-identification of Sweden and Canada as exceptionally caring and ethical states committed to the goal of global gender justice has
been reinforced through their adoption of feminist foreign policies (FFPs). However, despite the enthusiasm surrounding the potential of feminism as an ethical
approach to foreign policy making, critics have drawn attention to the many failings of FFPs that hamper their ability to bring about transformative change. This
article posits that the shortcomings of Swedish and Canadian FFPs are rooted in an unacknowledged legacy of colonial power relations. It is from within this history
of violence that Swedish and...

Abstract: This article argues that a liberal cosmopolitan approach to feminist foreign policy reproduces existing relations of power, including gender power relations
and Western liberal modes of domination. I suggest that a critical feminist ethic of care offers a potentially radical and transformative account of ethics as a basis for
a transnational feminism – one that reveals and troubles the binary gender norms that constitute the international and which exposes the ways in which patriarchal
orders uphold political hierarchies that obstruct the building of empathy and repairing of relationship. To illustrate this argument, I address the recent diplomatic
crises faced by...

Abstract: This study examines Spain’s gender-responsive migration policy as a foreign policy tool between 2020 and 2024, with a focus on the Mediterranean

Spain embeds feminist and human rights values into migration governance to enhance its international image and normative legitimacy. Findings show that Spain
increasingly employs migration policy not only to regulate cross-border mobility but also to project itself as a democratic and progressive actor, thereby strengthening
its soft power and role as a normative leader in...

Abstract: Abstract:A growing number of states, including Canada, Norway, Sweden, Australia, and the United Kingdom, have adopted gender- and feminist-informed

security and foreign policy. This article conducts an analysis of the incremental development of Sweden’s feminist foreign policy. It underlines three pillars that have
informed Swedish foreign policy: rights, representation, and resources. The article assesses how these three pillars have been transformed into distinct policy and
practice. It makes the following three conclusions. First, Sweden’s...

[39] Canada's New Feminist International Assistance Policy: Business as Usual?
Laura Parisi. Foreign Policy Analysis, 2020. 38 citations.
0% Topic Match
Abstract: This paper asks to what extent does Canada's new Feminist International Assistance Policy (FIAP) represent a more transformational and intersectional
approach to gender equality and neoliberal international development? In other words, what is “new” about Canada's international development policy when it
comes to gender equality and women's empowerment? Through a critical examination of the discourses of economic development in the FIAP on poverty, trade,
market citizenship, and the private sector, I argue that the FIAP embodies both neoliberal feminism as well as feminist neoliberalism, which limit the transformational
potential and impact of the FIAP on gender and international development strategies.

Abstract: Abstract Justin Trudeau, the current prime minister of Canada, says he is a feminist. His government has formulated a feminist foreign policy and has
presented official budgets alluding to intersectional feminism. Through discourse analysis, we examine how Trudeau’s self-description as a feminist manifests in his
official speeches spanning from 2015 to 2018; we also situate his positioning in relation to contemporary literature on intersectional feminism. Our study illustrates
what other scholars have identified as an increasingly difficult relationship between feminism and the dominant discourse of neoliberalism in political and policy
circles. Our findings suggest that Prime Minister Trudeau’s understanding of...

Abstract: ABSTRACT In 2017, the Canadian Liberal government introduced the Feminist International Assistance Policy (FIAP), which offers an “intersectional” lens
by taking into consideration the diversity of women and girls. This article argues that “intersectional” conceptualized inconsistently in FIAP, and outlines the dissimilar
understandings of intersectionality between GAC officials and civil society members. The lack of clarity around intersectionality is predictable given that this issue
fuels debates and dialogues in the field of intersectionality theory. As intersectionality has traveled from activist circles to academia and beyond, the theory of
intersectionality has often been reduced to a fuzzword and buzzword. Ultimately, this...

development in Burkina Faso. Based on systematic analysis of selected (inter)national development policy documents and in-depth stakeholder interviews, our
results show two main categories of problem representations: a) local culture/ informal structures that strengthen and are strengthened by patriarchy, and b) women’s
weak agency that undermine their effective participation. These problem representations are framed from two different but overlapping...

of climate change, public health, and socio-economic crises. For over three years, the government’s pledge to articulate not only a strategic foreign policy but one
with an explicitly feminist mandate, has remained unfulfilled. Given the risk of political instrumentalization of feminist labels and the lessons on policy-implementation
gap of global gender equality agendas, this article examines Canada’s readiness for a feminist global engagement. Through Wu et al.'s ([2015]. Policy capacity: A

Abstract: In October 2017, Canada launched its Feminist International Assistance Policy (FIAP). While Canada’s explicit use of the words “feminist” and “feminism”

central weaknesses of the FIAP can be seen as symptomatic of several endemic challenges that persist in the current policies and practices that seek to promote
gender equality in the developing world and beyond. This article presents the theoretical and conceptual lineage that has informed the FIAP, drawing from challenges
present within literature on...

Abstract: The Canadian Liberal government of Justin Trudeau claims to be ushering in a new era of a “feminist” foreign policy. While serious steps have been taken in

and language explicitly linking issues of disarmament and gender, reframing “security” as fundamentally a question not of state but of human (and environmental)
security. Ignoring its own public statements that repeatedly link women with peace and security, the Trudeau government’s opposition to the Treaty exposes the...

Canadian politics by storm with a platform promising change and a commitment to make Canadian international assistance explicitly “feminist”. Feminist scholars
have long argued that understanding gender inequality requires more than targeted projects, programs,...

roles: internationalist leader during the period of active foreign policy in the latter part of the Cold War, Europeanized follower during the height of reorientation towards
the EU and today’s Nordic balancer. The analysis reveals how Nordicness recently began re-appearing in a security environment characterized by increasing levels
of tension. Compared...

fervor, was indisputable. By 2019, the Trudeau government’s second foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, was proclaiming Canada’s feminist approach to international
relations openly and regularly. The international community had also noticed. This article investigates the origins of the new Canadian foreign policy “brand.” It finds
that, contrary to popular thinking, the prime minister himself...

Abstract: South Africa's leadership has sought ethical foreign policy since the advent of democracy. This foreign policy outlook focuses on the African continent and
includes certain articulations of pro-gender justice norms. In this article, I reflect on the extent to which South Africa's foreign policy embraces these norms as part
of its foreign apparatus and practices. It takes at its starting point the nascent literature on feminist foreign policy applied to South Africa, which shares similarities
to countries in the Global North that claim a feminist orientation to foreign policy. Moreover, it takes account of gender dynamics at the domestic...

examination of how gender concerns are, or can be, mainstreamed into regional policies; and through research on new forms of feminist-inspired activism that may
shape regional outcomes. After applying these perspectives to the case of North America and the new Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement, it argues that
despite the failure...

engagement with this set of norms. These processes have two components, the first being the translation between situated meanings, the second the actual
implementation of the concept, a dynamic that remains principally incomplete. To elucidate these claims, the article first presents translation dynamics in the work
of the CEDAW Committee, and then traces translation efforts in...

Abstract: ABSTRACT Despite self-congratulatory rhetoric, Canada compromised COVID-19 vaccine equity with policies impeding a proposed global waiver of
vaccine intellectual property (IP) rules. To learn from Canada’s vaccine nationalism we explore the worldview – a coherent textual picture of the world – in a sample
of Government of Canada communications regarding global COVID-19 vaccine sharing. Analysed documents portray risks and disparities as unrelated to the
dynamics and power relations of the Canadian and international economies. Against this depoliticised backdrop, economic growth fueled by strict IP rules and free
trade is advanced as the solution to inequities. Global vaccine access and distribution...

[77] Foreign Policy Change: From Policy Adjustments to Fundamental Reorientations
Tim Haesebrouck and Jeroen K. Joly. Political Studies Review, 2020. 25 citations.

Abstract: Over the last decades, an increasing number of empirical studies have examined foreign policy change. In this article, we provide an overview of different
conceptualizations and understandings of foreign policy change, identify the different drivers and inhibitors of change, and suggest avenues for future research.
Most importantly, this review argues that scholarship provides relevant insights in foreign policy change on specific issues, but currently fails to unravel cases of
more fundamental change like, redirections of states’ entire orientation toward world affairs or broader foreign policy categories (e.g. development aid or defense
and security policy). Moreover, while the literature on foreign...

Abstract: In this article we seek to understand how gendered coloniality is re-affirmed and reproduced. It does so by analysing the inter-national relationships
formalised through two recent policy initiatives by the Government of Canada: its Feminist International Assistance Policy and ongoing bilateral mechanisms with
Indigenous peoples organisations. Using feminist discourse analysis, we argue that the logics underpinning these initiatives are treated as mutually exclusive, with
the result being solitudes across policy areas – Indigenous reconciliation and feminist governance – that should instead overlap. Our analysis suggests that in
addition to failing to address systemic marginalisation, establishing exclusive domains of feminist and...

[80] When a “Feminist” Government Tackles Gender-Based Violence: A WPR Approach to the Speeches of Canadian Cabinet Ministers (2015–2019)
Bailey Gerrits. Canadian Journal of Political Science, 2024. 1 citations.

Abstract: Abstract Ending gender-based violence was a central promise of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's self-declared feminist government. Executive speeches
about gender-based violence provide clues about what types of feminist ideas undergird the 42nd Parliament. Was carceral feminism advanced, by focusing on
punishment? Or neoliberalized feminist ideas, by focusing on the market? Or social justice feminist ideas, by focusing on systemic change? Applying the concept
of governance feminism and using Bacchi's WPR approach, this article investigates how gender-based violence is problematized in English- and French-language
House of Commons debates in the 42nd Parliament by the cabinet. The speeches problematize gender-based violence as...

Abstract: ABSTRACT How do left- and right-leaning governments differ in their provision of foreign aid? As the case of Canada confirms, it is not clear that either
type gives more aid or that they spend it significantly differently. This article examines the claim that Stephen Harper’s government played to its Conservative base
and compares its record to that of Liberal governments. It finds that all governments over the past few decades have tried to brand their aid initiatives in ways that
will appeal to their respective bases. These changes are based on domestic electoral considerations, rather than the needs and priorities...

While these emerge within a broader context of self-styled “feminist” policymaking, this article represents the first study to assess the quantum strategy frameworks

and change in regard to gender and foreign policy? To address these major research questions and to spur cross-national comparative studies, this article advances
a theoretical framework on gendering foreign policy. It draws on two strands of research, which rarely engage with one another: international feminist theory (IFT)

Abstract: ABSTRACT Despite calls for no one to be left behind, women and girls with disabilities continue to face systemic marginalisation and gaps in rights
protections that limit their access to education, health, public services, and justice. Research in transnational and international relations offers little to help understand
this gendered disability injustice. This article examines how discussions of elements of justice as redistributive, recognition, participative and restorative address
people with disabilities as well as how disability rights within the United Nations treaty body system address the four elements of justice. Drawing on both academic
and community critiques of both disability rights...

Abstract: Resilience and gender have become new buzzwords for expressing renewal in peacebuilding. This article unpacks the gender-resilience nexus in theory
and analyses global trends and variation in peacebuilding policy and practice. It advances an analytical framework based on three central pillars of peacebuilding:
process, outcome, and expertise. A comprehensive analysis of 49 international peacebuilding handbooks, produced by leading international organisations for
policymakers and practitioners in the field, is conducted. The results show how the integration of the gender-resilience nexus signals new ways of understanding
conflict dynamics and peacebuilding. Yet, gender peace expertise is ‘thin’ with regard to policies and practices...

significant dominance of male gender participation and leadership in DIRCO related to female participation since 1994. This study uses Intersectionality theory and
Kanter's Theory to support this research with qualitative methods. The findings of this study indicate that women's participation is less than 50% when they hold
junior positions. It found that challenges limiting women's involvement in foreign policy decision-making include unfavorable cultural and traditional norms, religious
practices, lack of support for women, attitudes of influential men, financial...

Abstract: Abstract The Indian Ocean is the historic cross-roads of the world. On most measures—linguistic, religious, political, legal, and economic, among others—its
diversity is unparalleled. While the region is home to perhaps the most strategically important state actors in an age of intense superpower rivalry, it is equally home to
an astonishing range of nonstate actors whose influence and significance should not be underestimated. Many religious, indigenous, and local nonstate actors and
networks have a long pedigree, sometimes dating back centuries. Layered on these legacy organizations are a vast range of contemporary nonstate, transnational
regulators active in the region. These actors...

Approaching the topic from discourse-theoretical and intersectional perspectives, we ask how the inclusion of various social groups into the hegemonic project of
feminist politics becomes possible, what was constructed as an antagonist to feminist politics, and in what ways it impeded FI to realise such politics. Our findings
show that intersectionality allowed FI to include every group/individual into its feminist political project as long as they experienced oppression. Even though racists
and nationalists in general (the Sweden...

Abstract: Contrary to other subfields of international relations, foreign policy analysis (FPA) has not experienced a “critical turn” yet. This research note suggests
that this may be in part because FPA scholarship does already contain certain “critical” features, such as holding decision-makers to account and the incorporation
of various “subordinated” actors in its analyses. Having said that, FPA scholarship tends to fall short on other dimensions of critical scholarship. That is, despite its
relatively broad analytical net, it nonetheless silences certain actors, places little attention to the effects of foreign policy decisions, and shows a somewhat limited
ethical-political engagement. While...

Abstract: Abstract This article addresses second-wave feminist interventions in Canadian foreign policy debate with reference to two analytic streams: (1) political

the war in Ukraine, and global inflation have shown that there are many sites of sharp, continuing gender inequities. In response to this combined excitement and
challenge, this article addresses four areas of gender and IR research that are both enduring and growing: gender and political economy, gender...

leaders may pursue new foreign policies. At the same time, in democracies, leadership selection processes and policymaking rules blunt leaders' incentives and
opportunities for change. Democracies thus tend to pursue more consistent foreign policies than nondemocracies even when new leaders with different supporting
coalitions assume office. Statistical analyses of three distinct foreign policy...

Abstract: This article revisits the possibilities of the good international citizen (GIC) as a civilising agent in international society. It argues that an underdeveloped

beyond territorial borders, has long been associated with statist and nationalist purposes; however, a significant cosmopolitan, and civilising, potential can be found
within practices of ET in relation to human rights and certain aspects of criminal law such as in the practices of child sex tourism and trafficking. This form of ET...

Abstract: ABSTRACT In the early 2010s, the Canadian government increasingly integrated commercial self-interest into its foreign aid program. This article analyzes
the ostensible motives and impact of the rapid intensification of Canada's support to the extractive sector in Mongolia. It argues that, rather than a reflection of
Mongolia’s needs, the decision was donor-driven and resulted in apparently poorly designed projects with limited potential to advance Canadian aid’s objective of
reducing poverty, or even to meet the unofficial goal of benefitting Canadian mining companies. A potentially more productive approach would have been to help
reduce, not reinforce, Mongolia’s extreme dependence on mining.

Alexis Henshaw. Politics & Gender, 2022. 11 citations.

Abstract: Abstract Decentralized finance, including cryptocurrency and other blockchain-based applications, promises participants benefits such as financial
freedom, security, privacy, and wealth accumulation. More recently, it has also offered the promise of participation, lowering financial barriers, and empowerment—especially to women, the poor, and those residing in the Global South. I argue that the rise of decentralized finance as an alternative development platform is
explicitly gendered and calls for feminist analysis. I discuss how cryptocurrency-based approaches to development rest on foundations that are gendered, interacting
with hierarchies of race/ethnicity and class. I also explore how they are part of a lineage of neoliberalism,...

country’s commitment to gender equality, and interviews with low-income women pensioners in rural Sweden, this article explores why some women end up living
in poverty in later life. The article demonstrates how the Swedish pension reform of the 1990s has generated a structural lag; today’s older women have lived during

Abstract: Critical approaches to IR have often been criticized for lacking methodological rigour. Especially, authors informed by the works of Michel Foucault have
faced challenges to justify their methodology, given that Foucault did not provide scholars with a methodological blueprint. This article argues that Carol Bacchi’s
‘What’s the problem represented to be?’ (WPR) approach provides a robust critical methodology for policy analysis. WPR is a method that facilitates the critical
examination of public policies to analyse ‘how the “problem” is represented within them and to subject this problem representation to critical scrutiny’ (Bacchi, 2012b).
This way of questioning differs from other...

Abstract: through expectations of anal penetration for men and scissoring for women as PIV equivalents. Alongside mediated expectations of what is ‘normal’ or
‘expected’, the book highlights areas that are presented as dangerous – from HIV and AIDS to chemsex (the use of drugs in sexual activity) – contrasting advice
given from advocacy groups and sex professionals with the often sensationalised accounts and fearmongering in contemporary media. It notes that such issues
are frequently portrayed as a matter of individuals choosing to engage in risky behaviour, thus echoing the neoliberal rhetoric of much media discourse. However,
despite this narrative, there are...

Abstract: ABSTRACT Fatherhood ideals have been changing over the last decades, and Sweden has often been seen as a fore-runner when it comes to both
fatherhood policies and gender equality. In this article, we investigate how discourses about engaged, Swedish fathers and various formulations of gender equality
are linked to and used in the discursive production of Sweden as a nation. We use three communication campaigns launched by the Swedish Institute (a governmental
organization with the task of marketing Sweden), issued between 1968 and 2015. All campaigns emphasize modernity, rationality and self-development, but the
earliest represents women and men while the...

[146] Sweden, NATO and the gendered silencing of feminist foreign policy
Katharine A. M. Wright and Annika Bergman Rosamond. International Affairs, 2024. 4 citations.
Not measured Topic Match
Abstract: Sweden was the first state to adopt a Feminist Foreign Policy (FFP) in 2014, drawing on its state feminist tradition and support for the United Nations'
Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda. Yet following the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and Sweden's move to seek NATO
membership—abandoning its policy of non-alignment—a gendered silence on FFP pervaded. Significantly, this therefore predated the official abandonment of
FFP following the election of a new government in October 2022. NATO membership was viewed as incompatible with FFP. Yet, NATO has long sought to project
itself as a gender-just actor, including...

[147] Feminist foreign policy in Israel and Germany? The Women, Peace, and Security agenda, development policy, and female representation
Amnon Aran and Klaus Brummer. European Journal of International Security, 2024. 3 citations.

Abstract: Abstract This paper explores the relationship between feminist foreign policy (FFP) and a country’s national role conception (NRC). Specifically, it asks
whether countries with ‘masculine’ NRCs are opposed to the pursuit of FFP while countries with a more ‘feminine’ national role conception are advocates of FFP.
To this end, the paper conducts a comparative analysis of ‘masculine’ Israel and ‘feminine’ Germany along three domains: normative (with a focus on the Women,
Peace, and Security [WPS] agenda), material (in relation to development policy), and institutional (with reference to female representation). Generally speaking,
Germany has indeed undertaken broader and more substantive activities...

Devi Sharda. RESEARCH REVIEW International Journal of Multidisciplinary, 2024. 0 citations.

Abstract: In the current era of modernization of socio-economic development, the persistence of gender inequality demonstrates that our progress still falls short
of providing equal rights and opportunities to half of the population. This research highlights that gender inequality remains a global issue, depriving women and
marginalized communities of their rights and opportunities. It explores how feminist foreign policy can help mitigate gender inequality. Nations today need to shift
their foreign policy focus from traditional issues (such as war, security, and military power) to social justice, inclusivity, and sustainable development. The feminist
perspective asserts that issues of war, peace, and development...

Abstract: Given the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the Feminist Foreign Policy (FFP) institutionalisation by Mexico (2020) and Chile (2023), this study
analyses their differentiated responses to empirically assess FFP's promised potential to achieve autonomy in foreign policymaking. Through a thematic analysis,
we examined the official stances towards the war, diplomatic interactions, and specific cooperation policies proposed or supported by the two countries. The results
are twofold: (1) theoretically, FFP challenges conventional theories on international relations and foreign policymaking by fostering a nuanced understanding of the
war thus creating conditions for developing autonomous discourses and policies, and (2) empirically, FFP...

Abstract: In order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the process by which feminist foreign policy from Sweden has diffused to other major European countries,
this study employs the framework of differentiated Europeanisation. This approach combines the theoretical discussions on Europeanisation and differentiated
integration that have been developed in recent years in European integration theory. To this end, the study first examines the definition and history of feminist foreign
policy, and then discusses the theoretical development and features of the main analytical framework, differentiated Europeanisation. The processes of the diffusion

Abstract: The paper intends to argue how ethics can find its functional position within the implementation of Feminist Foreign Policy (FFP) without challenging the
reality of the social, economic, and political conditions of the country by describing the main features of feminist foreign policy and focusing on the ethical principles
of the policy. The study aims to understand how feminist foreign policy adopts ethical views and achieves the successful realization of these principles in a global
context. Considering the challenging nature of the international arena and the different national interests of the actors, feminist foreign policy faces various difficulties

Abstract: Feminist foreign policy (FFP) ensures the representation and participation of women both nationally and internationally. Initially, it aimed to focus on some
special areas relating to women, peace and security especially sexual violence in conflict and women representation in peace process. Now, the ambit has been
broadened and issues relating to climate change are also included. The research has already proved that women suffer double victimization as a consequence
of climate change. Climate change exacerbates sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV), so, they face all types of consequences of climate change (CC) and
natural disasters as human beings but they face...

[155] Contesting feminist power Europe: is Feminist Foreign Policy possible for the EU?

Abstract: ABSTRACT Since 2014, several European Union (EU) member states have adopted their own versions of “Feminist Foreign Policy” (FFP). Increasingly,
feminist bureaucrats, politicians, activists and scholars are calling for the EU to do the same. This article scrutinises claims to the feminist actorsness of the EU
by introducing the analytical concept of Feminist Power Europe (FPE). In employing FPE the article examines whether the EU can adopt a FFP that upholds
transformative potential of feminism. Undertaking critical content analysis of key documents, we identify three overarching feminist frames that emerge in the EU’s
external policies: (1) Liberal; (2) Intersectional; (3)...

Abstract: In 2014, Sweden became the first country to adopt a feminist foreign policy. Although a new Swedish government abandoned the country’s feminist foreign
policy in October 2022, Sweden has inspired many other states to adopt such a foreign policy to advance the status of women and girls. These developments have
not gone unnoticed in South Africa, where historical relations between Swedenand the country’s liberation movements endure in post-apartheid South Africa. Unlike
Sweden, South Africa never adopted or declared a feminist foreign policy due to historical and cultural reasons, and different conceptualisations of women, gender,
and feminism. Instead, under the leadership...

Abstract: As a middle-ranking power that projects its vision internationally and aspires for global recognition, India is embedded in its specific traditions and presents
itself as a voice of the Global South. India promotes dialogue as opposed to confrontation and has from the highest level stated ‘this is not the time for war’. Peace
as rhetoric and practice constitutes a feminist principle. In the light of this positioning, what would a feminist foreign policy (FFP) look like and how should it be
measured? In this article, we trace recent debates on an FFP and examine how it can conceptually apply...

Abstract: Recently, former colonial powers in the Global North have begun addressing their colonial pasts through their foreign policies. Some of these states pursue
a feminist foreign policy (FFP). However, to date, only one FFP makes explicit mention of colonial legacies: that of Germany, adopted in 2021. How does German FFP
discourse address this and what political work does this do? Contributing to critiques of coloniality in FFP, we analyze the discursive representation of Germany’s
colonial past in foreign policy texts since 2021. Drawing on the socio-critical concepts theater of reconciliation by Max Czollek and remembrance superiority by
Mohamed Amjahid,...

Abstract: The adoption of a feminist foreign policy (FFP) by Mexico took Mexican feminist civil society by surprise. In September 2019, without prior consultations or
dialogues with local feminist civil society, the Mexican Foreign Affairs Secretary announced its FFP during the 74th session of the UN General Assembly. While the
UN New York City headquarters roared with applause in response to the Mexican Foreign Affairs Secretary’s claim that the “Mexican government is feminist,” many
feminists in Mexico interpreted the statement as an effort to pinkwash the government’s poor track record on gender equality within its borders. Moreover, Mexico’s
FFP was charged...

Abstract: ABSTRACT This conclusion to the special issue notes the persistent use of binary frames in conceptions of (European) security. Such frames reify and
limit our ability to make sense of key security challenges, not least by occluding their gendered and racialised dimensions. Therefore, it asks: How to move beyond
binaries towards a more nuanced, inclusive and impactful conception of (European) security? Developing an answer via synthetic engagement of the articles in this
collection – and their sources in gender and postcolonial studies – it argues that we can begin to challenge binaries with a relational approach operationalised by

Abstract: In 2020, the European Parliament (ep) issued a resolution calling for all European Union (EU) Member States to adopt feminist foreign and security policies,
and for a gender-transformative vision in the EU’s own external policy. Drawing on the literatures on negotiations and norm contestation, this article3 asks why the
resolution was so progressive. It also asks how we can characterize and explain the nature of the negotiations leading to the resolution. The findings demonstrate
a low level of contestation and negotiations mainly characterized by integrative strategies and solutions. The main opponents to the resolution, the populist radical
right groups,...

Nicholas Ross Smith and Bonnie Holster. Global Policy, 2025. 0 citations.

Abstract: During Nanaia Mahuta's tenure as New Zealand's Foreign Minister (2020–2023), Aotearoa New Zealand experimented with a foreign policy guided by four
tikanga (Mori customary practices), namely, manaakitanga (hospitality), whanaungatanga (connectedness), mahi tahi and kotahitanga (unity through collaboration),
and kaitiakitanga (intergenerational guardianship). However, despite a clear rhetorical increase in the use of Mori perspectives, in practice, New Zealand's foreign
policymaking remained ontologically and epistemologically Westerncentric. This paper argues that if New Zealand undertakes further experimentation with a Mori
foreign policy in the future, then embracing the Mori concept of utu—broadly defined as the notion of balance through reciprocation—would provide a useful...

Abstract: Climate change is a public health threat that disproportionately impacts certain groups more than others. Getting old is something that most of us will
experience during our lifetime, and older adults are among those at elevated risk for adverse impacts due to climate change. As a result, it behooves us as a society
to consider how we will approach mitigating climate change impacts on older adults. We must carefully consider what ethical principles underpin the policies and
laws that affect older adults, particularly as the world is facing increasing challenges with the distribution of resources. This paper argues for...

Abstract: Building upon its development in educational scholarship, feminist scholars have incorporated the concept of ‘critical friend’ into their methodologies. Within
political science, feminists have articulated critical friendship as relational research praxis, applying the concept to relationships between feminist academics and
gender experts in institutions. We bring this research into conversation with feminist care ethics, asking how commitments to care ethics interact with commitments
to being a ‘critical friend’ in feminist political science research. Based on interviews with feminist researchers, we argue that care is intrinsic to feminist research and
underpins friendship. Whether or not it is explicitly articulated, the concept...

Abstract: In this article we explore how Swedish citizens perceive security threats, and how threat perceptions overlap with ideology, trust and demographics. The
results show that concerns over security threats are foremost connected to an authoritarian outlook. In addition, four typical groups of security orientations were
identified. On the one end of the spectrum, we found one group with anti-immigrant, anti-feminist and anti-egalitarian opinions and low confidence in media and
institutions. At the other end, we identified a group dominated by women with university degrees, who believe in egalitarian tolerance and display trust in societal
institutions. Even though the findings are...
