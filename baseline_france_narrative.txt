Baseline credibility (France)

Summary: France’s feminist diplomacy credibility is moderate, anchored by visible commitments but constrained by resource intensity and institutional embedding depth.

Resources: ODA tagged with gender objectives is ~46% (2022, sourceId: focus2030_which_countries_gender_2025), below the 75% target; principal‑objective ODA is ~6% vs a 20% ambition. Direct funding to feminist CSOs totals ~USD 105M (2022–2023, Focus 2030), indicating a modest but identifiable channel.

Institutional depth: The 2025–2030 International Strategy is active and gender is framed as cross‑cutting (Programming Law 2021); we treat this as embedded for scoring purposes pending further audit.

Norm-setting: France plays ongoing roles in Generation Equality (co‑hosted 2021) and participates in EU/G7 gender initiatives; leadership roles (e.g., chair) vary by year.

Caveats: Where placeholders or proxies exist (CSO funding, some role specifications), interpretations should be treated as preliminary; Evidence shows exact coverage and sources.
