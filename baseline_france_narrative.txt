Baseline credibility (France)

Summary: France’s feminist diplomacy credibility is moderate, anchored by visible commitments but constrained by resource intensity and institutional embedding depth.

Resources: ODA tagged with gender objectives is ~46.4% (2022, sourceId: focus2030_2024), below the 75% target noted in policy discourse; principal-objective ODA is ~6.3% vs a 20% ambition. Direct funding to feminist CSOs is currently a placeholder; until verified, this suppresses confidence in the Resources pillar.

Institutional depth: The 2025–2030 International Strategy is active (strategy status) and the WPS NAP (2021–2025) remains in force, indicating structured but not fully embedded practice across ministries.

Norm-setting: France plays ongoing roles in Generation Equality (co-hosted 2021) and participates in EU/G7 gender initiatives; leadership roles (e.g., chair) vary by year.

Caveats: Where placeholders or broad proxies exist (CSO funding, some role specifications), interpretations should be treated as preliminary; Evidence shows exact coverage and sources.
