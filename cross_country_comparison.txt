Cross-country pillar comparison (France vs Sweden legacy)

Resources: Sweden’s FFP legacy is widely associated with higher gender marker usage; principal (DAC 2) intensity is the critical differentiator. France’s marker share has risen but principal focus lags. This mechanism matters because principal projects better signal non-tokenistic commitment and tend to correlate with targeted instruments (CSOs, specialized lines).

Institutional depth: Both had strategies; Sweden’s label discontinuation in 2022 marks a break in continuity. France’s current strategy provides continuity potential, but “embeddedness” across ministries remains the test. The mechanism is policy resilience: embedded approaches withstand political shifts better than label-centric ones.

Norm-setting: Sweden historically leaned into WPS advocacy (“champion” proxy); France’s profile is stronger on coalition convening (GEF 2021) with variable chair roles in EU/G7. Mechanism: visible external leadership can offset weaker resource intensity in credibility perception, but only to a point.

Takeaway: The comparison suggests credibility hinges on sustained principal focus (resources) plus institutional embedding (depth); norm leadership amplifies but does not substitute.
